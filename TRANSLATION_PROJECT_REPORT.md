## 📝 Excel Column Structure

Each translation sheet contains three columns optimized for translators:

| Column | Name | Width | Description |
|--------|------|-------|-------------|
| **A** | English Text | 60 chars | The original text to translate |
| **B** | Screen/Context | 40 chars | Where the text appears in the app |
| **C** | Notes | 50 chars | Context, type, special instructions |

### Notes Column Information

The Notes column provides critical context:
- **String Type:** Button, Label, Error, Dialog, etc.
- **Placeholders:** Indicates dynamic variables (e.g., `{count}`, `$name`)
- **Special Instructions:** Character limits, error types, success messages
- **Formatting:** Bold, italics, links if applicable

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Extraction Process

**Step 1: Pattern Matching**
- Used 7 different RegEx patterns to capture various string types
- Text widgets, AppBar titles, form inputs, buttons, dialogs, snackbars
- Special handling for multi-line strings and nested widgets

**Step 2: Filtering & Cleaning**
- Removed technical strings using 15+ keyword filters
- Filtered camelCase/snake_case variable names
- Removed URLs, paths, and configuration strings
- Normalized whitespace and newlines

**Step 3: Deduplication**
- Identified duplicate strings across files
- Preserved duplicates when context differs significantly
- Combined screen contexts for true duplicates
- Result: 57% reduction (8,753 → 3,734 strings)

**Step 4: Categorization**
- Intelligent file path analysis
- 12 logical categories based on app features
- "Common/Shared" for cross-cutting strings

**Step 5: Context Enrichment**
- Added screen/location information
- Generated translator-helpful notes
- Flagged placeholders and variables
- Indicated string types (button, error, etc.)

## 📖 How to Use the Excel File

### For Translators

1. **Open the Excel file:** `StepzSync_Translation_Master.xlsx`

2. **Read Instructions sheet** for translation guidelines

3. **Choose your workflow:**
   - **Option A:** Add columns D, E, F, etc. for each target language
   - **Option B:** Create a copy of the file for each language
   - **Option C:** Export to Google Sheets for collaborative translation

4. **Translate systematically:**
   - Start with high-priority sheets (Auth, Race Management, Dialogs)
   - Pay attention to Notes column for context
   - Preserve placeholders like `{count}`, `$name`, `%s`
   - Keep button labels concise
   - Maintain consistency across similar strings

5. **Use Summary sheet** to track progress

### For Developers

1. **Reference file:** Use for implementing Flutter localization (`.arb` files)

2. **String IDs:** Generate from screen context + original text

3. **Placeholders:** Map variables to Flutter's ICU message format

4. **Integration:** Convert to `app_en.arb`, `app_es.arb`, etc.

5. **Update:** Re-run extraction scripts when adding new features

- → Send to translation team

### Phase 2: Flutter Integration (Future)
- [ ] Install `flutter_localizations` package
- [ ] Create `.arb` files from Excel
- [ ] Generate `AppLocalizations` class
- [ ] Replace hardcoded strings with localization calls
- [ ] Add locale switching UI

### Phase 3: Testing (Future)

- [ ] Verify text fits in UI elements
- [ ] Check right-to-left (RTL) languages
- [ ] Validate placeholders work correctly

### Phase 4: Maintenance (Ongoing)
- [ ] Re-run extraction after major updates
- [ ] Track new strings for translation
- [ ] Update existing translations as needed

## 🔧 Technical Notes

### Extraction Accuracy

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Captures all Text() widgets reliably
- ✅ Handles multi-line strings correctly
- ✅ Preserves context and location
- ✅ Filters technical strings effectively
- ✅ Handles special characters and emojis

**Limitations:**
- Some strings in complex conditional logic may have incomplete context
- Dynamically constructed strings (e.g., `"$var1 $var2"`) captured as is
- Controller getter methods captured correctly but marked as such
- Very complex nested widgets may need manual verification

### Recommended Manual Review

Consider manually reviewing these areas:
1. Race countdown messages (time formatting)
2. Distance/step calculations (number formatting)
3. Date/time displays (locale-specific formats)
4. Currency displays (if applicable)
5. Pluralization rules (e.g., "1 friend" vs "2 friends")

## 📞 Support & Questions

### Common Questions

**Q: Can I add more columns for additional languages?**
A: Yes! Simply add columns D, E, F, etc. with headers like "Spanish (es)", "French (fr)", etc.

**Q: What do I do with placeholders like {count} or $name?**
A: Do NOT translate these. Keep them exactly as-is in your translation. They will be replaced with actual values at runtime.

**Q: Some strings appear multiple times in different contexts. Should I translate them differently?**
A: Check the Screen/Context column. If the context is different, the translation might need to differ. Otherwise, maintain consistency.

**Q: How long should button labels be?**
A: Try to keep them under 15-20 characters if possible to ensure they fit on mobile screens.

**Q: What about strings with special formatting (bold, italic)?**
A: The Notes column will indicate this. Preserve the same emphasis in your translation.

### Issues or Clarifications

If you encounter:
- Unclear context for a string
- Technical terms needing explanation
- Strings that seem incomplete
- Questions about placeholders
