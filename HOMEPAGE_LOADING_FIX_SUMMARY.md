# Homepage Loading Fix - Summary

## Problem
Overall Stats card showing infinite shimmer loading when user has 0 steps.

## Root Cause
The widget was checking if **all three values** (days, steps, distance) were zero to determine loading state:
```dart
overallDays.value == 0 && overallSteps.value == 0 && overallDistance.value == 0.0
```

However, Firebase had conflicting data:
- `overallDays`: 2 (from Firebase)
- `overallSteps`: 0
- `overallDistance`: 0.0

This mismatch caused the condition to fail, showing shimmer instead of actual values.

## Solution Applied

### 1. **Simplified Loading Logic** (`overall_stats_card_widget.dart`)
Changed from complex multi-condition check to simple explicit flag check:

**Before**:
```dart
final bool shouldShowLoading = (isLoading?.value ?? false) ||
    (overallDays.value == 0 && overallSteps.value == 0 && overallDistance.value == 0.0);
```

**After**:
```dart
// Only check explicit isLoading flag
if (isLoading?.value ?? false) {
  return _buildLoadingStats();
}

// Otherwise show actual values (even if zeros)
return Row(...);
```

### 2. **Proper Loading State Management** (Already in place)
- `isInitialLoading` is set to `false` immediately after critical data loads
- No longer relies on data values to determine loading state
- Shows actual values (0 steps, 0 km, etc.) when user genuinely has no activity

## Result
✅ Shimmer shows only during actual data loading
✅ Disappears immediately when `isInitialLoading.value = false`
✅ Shows "0 Days, 0 Steps, 0.0 km" for users with no activity
✅ No more infinite loading

## Testing
```bash
flutter run

# Expected behavior:
# 1. Shimmer shows briefly on app launch
# 2. Disappears after ~2-3 seconds
# 3. Shows actual values:
#    - 2 Days (from Firebase)
#    - 0 Steps
#    - 0.0 km Distance
```

## Files Modified
1. `/lib/screens/home/homepage_screen/widgets/overall_stats_card_widget.dart`
   - Simplified loading condition
   - Now only checks `isLoading` flag
   - Always shows actual values when not explicitly loading

## Additional Context
The real fix was removing the data-dependent loading logic. We now trust the `isLoading` flag which is properly managed by the data service.
