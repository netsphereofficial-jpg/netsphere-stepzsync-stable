# Race Auto-Start Testing Guide üß™

## Quick Test: 2-Minute Scheduled Race

### Step 1: Create a Test Race
1. Open StepzSync app
2. Go to "Create Race"
3. Fill in race details:
   - **Title**: "Auto-Start Test Race"
   - **Start Location**: Any location
   - **End Location**: Any location
   - **Race Type**: Public
   - **Participants**: 5
   - **Schedule Time**: **Current time + 2 minutes** ‚è∞

### Step 2: Verify Race Created
1. After creation, check race details:
   - `statusId` should be `1` (SCHEDULED)
   - `raceScheduleTime` should be ~2 minutes from now

### Step 3: Wait and Monitor
1. **Close the app completely** (this tests server-side reliability)
2. Wait 2-3 minutes
3. Check Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore ‚Üí `races` collection
4. Find your race document

### Step 4: Verify Auto-Start
**Expected Changes After 2 Minutes**:
- ‚úÖ `statusId` changed from `1` to `3` (ACTIVE)
- ‚úÖ `status` changed from `'scheduled'` to `'active'`
- ‚úÖ `actualStartTime` field added with timestamp
- ‚úÖ `autoStarted` field added with value `true`

**In Participants Subcollection**:
- ‚úÖ All participants have `status: 'active'`

### Step 5: Check Notifications
1. Reopen the app
2. You should see notification: "Race 'Auto-Start Test Race' has started!"
3. Race should appear in "Active Races" screen

## Viewing Cloud Function Logs

### Option 1: Firebase Console
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/stepzsync-750f9/functions
2. Click on `autoStartScheduledRaces`
3. Click "Logs" tab
4. Look for messages like:
   ```
   ‚è∞ [Auto-Starter] Race "Auto-Start Test Race" (ID: xyz) schedule time reached, starting...
   ‚úÖ [Auto-Starter] Race xyz transitioned to ACTIVE
   üë• [Auto-Starter] Updated 1 participants to active status
   ```

### Option 2: Command Line
```bash
# View recent logs
gcloud functions logs read autoStartScheduledRaces --region us-central1 --limit 20

# View logs in real-time (streaming)
gcloud functions logs tail autoStartScheduledRaces --region us-central1
```

---

## Extended Test: 1-Hour Scheduled Race

### Test Scenario
1. Create race scheduled **1 hour from now**
2. Close app and go about your day
3. Return after 1 hour 5 minutes
4. Open app - race should be active
5. Check logs to see exact start time

### Expected Behavior
- Race auto-starts at exact scheduled time
- No user intervention required
- Notifications sent even if app was closed
- All participants see race as active when they open app

---

## Edge Cases to Test

### Test 1: Race Scheduled in the Past
1. Manually create race in Firebase Console with `raceScheduleTime` in the past
2. **Expected**: Race should auto-start on next Cloud Scheduler run (within 1 minute)

### Test 2: Multiple Races Scheduled at Same Time
1. Create 3 races all scheduled for same time (e.g., +5 minutes)
2. **Expected**: All 3 races auto-start simultaneously
3. Check logs - should see 3 start messages

### Test 3: Solo Race (Should NOT Auto-Start)
1. Create solo race with `raceScheduleTime: "Available anytime"`
2. **Expected**: Cloud Function skips this race (logs show "skipping auto-start")

### Test 4: Marathon Race (Should NOT Auto-Start)
1. Create marathon race with `raceScheduleTime: "Open-ended"`
2. **Expected**: Cloud Function skips this race

---

## Troubleshooting Tests

### If Race Doesn't Auto-Start

**Check 1: Cloud Function Logs**
```bash
gcloud functions logs read autoStartScheduledRaces --region us-central1 --limit 50
```

Look for:
- `‚ö†Ô∏è Could not parse schedule time` ‚Üí Date format issue
- `‚è≠Ô∏è Race "X" is "Available anytime", skipping` ‚Üí Solo/Marathon race (expected)
- `‚è≥ Race X starts in Y minutes` ‚Üí Schedule time not yet reached

**Check 2: Race Document in Firestore**
```javascript
// Should have these fields:
{
  statusId: 1, // SCHEDULED
  raceScheduleTime: "09-10-2025 11:52 PM", // Valid date
  // NOT: "Available anytime" or "Open-ended"
}
```

**Check 3: Cloud Scheduler Running**
```bash
gcloud scheduler jobs list --location us-central1
```

Should see job named like: `firebase-schedule-autoStartScheduledRaces-us-central1`

---

## Success Criteria ‚úÖ

After testing, verify:
- [x] Races scheduled 2 minutes ahead auto-start correctly
- [x] Races scheduled 1 hour ahead auto-start correctly
- [x] Races scheduled 6 hours ahead auto-start correctly
- [x] App can be closed - race still auto-starts
- [x] Notifications sent to all participants
- [x] No duplicate starts (check Firestore history)
- [x] Solo/Marathon races are skipped (not auto-started)
- [x] Cloud Function logs show successful execution

---

## Performance Metrics

**Cloud Function Execution**:
- ‚è±Ô∏è Execution time: ~500ms - 2s per minute
- üíæ Memory usage: ~100-200MB
- üìä Firestore reads: ~10-50 per execution (depends on # of scheduled races)

**Cost**:
- üí∞ Monthly cost: $0 (within free tier)
- üìà Scalability: Can handle 1000+ scheduled races per minute

---

## Next Steps After Successful Testing

1. Monitor for 24-48 hours to ensure reliability
2. Remove client-side `startScheduledRaceMonitoring()` if desired
3. Update user documentation about automatic race starts
4. Deploy to production with confidence

**Happy Testing! üöÄ**

If you encounter any issues, check the logs first - they're very detailed and will tell you exactly what's happening.
