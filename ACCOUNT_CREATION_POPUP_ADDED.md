**Date:** October 23, 2025
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## 🎯 Feature Overview

Added a confirmation dialog that appears when a user tries to sign in with an email that doesn't have an account yet. This gives users control over whether to create a new account or cancel.

## 🎨 Popup Design

### Visual Elements:
- **Icon:** Person add icon in a circular background
- **Title:** "Account Not Found"
- **Message:** "No account found with [email]. Would you like to create a new account with this email?"
- **Buttons:**
  - **Cancel** - Outlined button (user returns to login screen)
  - **Create Account** - Filled primary button (creates account)

### Design System:
- Uses existing `AppDesignColors` for consistency
- Google Fonts (Roboto for title, Poppins for body)
- 16px border radius for modern look
- Email highlighted in primary color for emphasis

## 🔄 User Flow

### Scenario: Sign in with non-existent email

**Before (no popup):**
```
1. User enters non-existent email + password
2. Taps "Sign In"
3. Account automatically created
4. User signed in (no choice)
```

**After (with popup):**
```
1. User enters non-existent email + password
2. Taps "Sign In"
3. 🆕 POPUP APPEARS: "Account Not Found - Create account with [email]?"

   Option A: User taps "Cancel"
   → Returns to login screen
   → Can switch to Sign Up mode or use different email

## 💻 Technical Implementation

### File Modified:
`lib/controllers/login/login_controller.dart`

### Changes Made:

#### 1. Updated Sign-In Flow (lines 278-319):
```dart
if (e.code == 'user-not-found' || e.code == 'invalid-credential') {
  // Stop loading to show dialog
  isLoading.value = false;

  // Show confirmation dialog
  final shouldCreate = await _showAccountCreationDialog(email);

  if (!shouldCreate) {
    // User cancelled
    return;
  }

  // Resume loading
  isLoading.value = true;

  // Create account (user confirmed)
  userCredential = await _auth.createUserWithEmailAndPassword(
    email: email,
    password: password,
  );
}
```

#### 2. Added Dialog Method (lines 938-1060):
```dart
/// Show account creation confirmation dialog
Future<bool> _showAccountCreationDialog(String email) async {
  final result = await Get.dialog<bool>(
    Dialog(
      // ... beautiful dialog UI
    ),
    barrierDismissible: false, // Must click a button
  );

  return result ?? false;
}
```
