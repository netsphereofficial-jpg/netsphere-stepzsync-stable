## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Test 1: First Finisher + Deadline Alert
1. Create a multi-participant race
2. Start the race
3. Have one participant complete the race distance
4. **Expected Results**:
   - First finisher receives: "🏁 First to Finish!"
   - All other participants receive: "⏰ Deadline Approaching! {finisherName} finished first! You have {X} minutes..."
   - Race statusId changes to 6 (ENDING)

**Verification**:
```
🔍 Check Firebase Console Logs:
- "⏰ Race {title} ending - first finisher detected"
- "✅ First finisher notification sent to {userId}"
- "✅ Deadline alert notifications sent: X succeeded, Y failed"
```

---

### Test 2: Race Cancellation
1. Create a race with participants
2. Cancel the race (call `RaceStateMachine.transitionToCancelled()`)
3. **Expected Results**:
   - All participants receive: "❌ Race Cancelled - The race '{name}' has been cancelled. Reason: {reason}"
   - Race statusId changes to 7

**Verification**:
```
🔍 Check Firebase Console Logs:
- "❌ Race {title} cancelled"
- "✅ Race cancelled notifications sent: X succeeded, Y failed"
```

---

### Test 3: Milestone Notifications
1. Start a race with 10km total distance
2. Have a participant reach 2.5km (25%)
3. **Expected Results**:
   - Participant receives: "Milestone Reached! 🎯 - Great job! You've completed 25% of the race!"
   - All other participants receive: "{userName} Hit 25%! 🎯 - {userName} reached 25%..."
   - Participant's `reachedMilestones` array updated to `[25]`

4. Continue to 5km (50%) and 7.5km (75%)
5. **Expected Results**: Similar notifications with different emojis (⚡, 🔥)

**Verification**:
```
🔍 Check Firebase Console Logs:
- "🎯 Milestone reached: {userId} hit 25% in race {raceId}"
- "✅ Personal milestone notification sent to {userId} (25%)"
- "✅ Milestone alert notifications sent: X succeeded, Y failed"

🔍 Check Firestore:
- races/{raceId}/participants/{userId}
- Field: reachedMilestones: [25, 50, 75]
```

---

## 🚦 Milestone Detection Logic

The server-side milestone detection works as follows:

```javascript
// In onParticipantUpdated Cloud Function:
const oldDistance = beforeData.distance || 0;
const newDistance = afterData.distance || 0;
const totalDistance = raceData.totalDistance;

const oldProgress = (oldDistance / totalDistance) * 100;
const newProgress = (newDistance / totalDistance) * 100;

// Check each milestone (25, 50, 75)
for (const milestone of [25, 50, 75]) {
  // Conditions:
  // 1. Old progress was BELOW milestone (not reached yet)
  // 2. New progress is AT OR ABOVE milestone (just crossed)
  // 3. Milestone not already in reachedMilestones array (prevent duplicates)
  if (oldProgress < milestone &&
      newProgress >= milestone &&
      !reachedMilestones.includes(milestone)) {

    // Update participant doc with reached milestone
    await participantRef.update({
      reachedMilestones: FieldValue.arrayUnion(milestone)
    });

    // Send notifications
    await sendMilestonePersonalNotification(userId, raceInfo, milestone);
    await sendMilestoneAlertNotification(raceId, raceInfo, userName, milestone, userId);
  }
}
```

---

## 📝 Database Schema Updates

### New Fields Added

**`races/{raceId}/participants/{userId}` collection**:
```javascript
{
  // ... existing fields ...
  reachedMilestones: [25, 50, 75], // ✅ NEW: Array of milestone percentages reached
}
```

**`races/{raceId}` document** (set by race_state_machine.dart):
```javascript
{
  // ... existing fields ...
  firstFinisherUserId: "userId", // ✅ NEW: User who finished first
  firstFinishedAt: Timestamp,    // ✅ NEW: When first finisher completed
  raceDeadline: Timestamp,       // ✅ NEW: Deadline for others to finish
  cancellationReason: "string",  // ✅ NEW: Why race was cancelled
}
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Deadline Calculation
When first participant finishes, the deadline is calculated as:

```javascript
// From race_state_machine.dart (transitionToEnding)
final deadline = DateTime.now().add(Duration(minutes: durationMinutes));

// Default: 30 minutes after first finisher
// Can be customized per race type
```

### Milestone Thresholds
Hardcoded to industry-standard race milestones:
- **25%** - Quarter mark (🎯)
- **50%** - Halfway point (⚡)
- **75%** - Three-quarter mark (🔥)

---

## 🐛 Debugging & Monitoring

### Firebase Console Logs to Monitor

**First Finisher + Deadline Alert**:
```
⏰ Race "XYZ" ending - first finisher detected (ID: abc123)
🎯 Milestone reached: userId hit 75% in race raceId
✅ First finisher notification sent to userId
✅ Deadline alert notifications sent: 5 succeeded, 0 failed
```

**Race Cancellation**:
```
❌ Race "XYZ" cancelled (ID: abc123)
✅ Race cancelled notifications sent: 8 succeeded, 0 failed
```

**Milestones**:
```
🎯 Milestone reached: userId123 hit 25% in race raceAbc
✅ Personal milestone notification sent to userId123 (25%)
✅ Milestone alert notifications sent: 7 succeeded, 0 failed
```

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue**: Milestone notifications sent multiple times
**Solution**: Check `reachedMilestones` array - should only contain each milestone once

**Issue**: Deadline alert sent to participants who already finished
**Solution**: Verification code filters out `isCompleted: true` participants

**Issue**: First finisher notification not sent
**Solution**: Ensure `firstFinisherUserId` field is set when statusId changes to 6

## 📈 Performance Considerations

### Optimizations Implemented:
1. **Milestone Deduplication**: `reachedMilestones` array prevents duplicate notifications
2. **Smart Filtering**: Deadline alerts skip completed participants
3. **Batch Processing**: Milestone alerts sent in parallel to all participants
4. **Error Handling**: Notification failures don't break core race functionality

### Firestore Read Costs:
- **First Finisher**: 2 reads (race doc + first finisher participant doc)
- **Deadline Alert**: 1 + N reads (race + N participants)
- **Cancellation**: 1 + N reads (race + N participants)
- **Milestones**: 2 + N reads (race + participant + N other participants)

---
