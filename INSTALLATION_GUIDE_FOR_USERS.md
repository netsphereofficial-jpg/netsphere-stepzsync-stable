## Welcome to StepZSync!

This guide will help you install StepZSync on your Android device.

---

## System Requirements

Before installing, please ensure your device meets these requirements:

- **Android Version**: Android 8.0 (Oreo) or higher
- **Storage Space**: At least 150 MB free space
- **Internet Connection**: Required for initial setup and syncing
- **Permissions**: Location, Activity Recognition, and Health Connect (Android 14+)

---

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Download the APK

1. Download the file named **`app-release.apk`**
2. Wait for the download to complete
3. Note the download location (usually in your "Downloads" folder)

**Important**: Make sure you download the file completely. The file size should be approximately 105 MB.

### Step 2: Uninstall Previous Version (If Applicable)

**If you already have StepZSync installed**, you MUST uninstall it first:

1. Open **Settings** on your device
2. Go to **Apps** (or **Applications**)
3. Find and tap on **StepZSync**
4. Tap **Uninstall**
5. If you see an option **"Uninstall for all users"**, use that instead
6. **Restart your phone** after uninstalling

**Why this is important**: Android requires the same signing certificate for updates. If you skip this step, you may see an "App not installed" error.

### Step 3: Enable Installation from Unknown Sources

Since StepZSync is not being installed from the Google Play Store, you need to allow installation from other sources:

**Method 1: During Installation (Easiest)**
1. Try to install the APK (tap on the downloaded file)
2. If blocked, Android will show a message
3. Tap **"Settings"** in the message
4. Enable **"Allow from this source"**
5. Go back and tap the APK file again

**Method 2: Manual Configuration**
1. Open **Settings**
2. Go to **Security** or **Apps & notifications**
3. Find **"Install unknown apps"** or **"Special app access"**
4. Select your browser or file manager (e.g., Chrome, Files)
5. Enable **"Allow from this source"**

### Step 4: Install the APK

1. Open your **File Manager** or **Downloads** app
2. Navigate to where you downloaded **app-release.apk**
3. Tap on the file
4. Tap **"Install"**
5. Wait for the installation to complete (may take 30-60 seconds)
6. Tap **"Open"** to launch StepZSync

**If Google Play Protect appears**:
- You may see a warning: "App blocked by Play Protect"
- Tap **"More details"**
- Tap **"Install anyway"**
- This is normal for apps installed outside the Play Store

### Step 5: Grant Permissions

When you first open StepZSync, it will request several permissions:

1. **Location** - Required for tracking runs and races
2. **Physical Activity** - Required for step counting
3. **Health Connect** (Android 14+) - Required for comprehensive health data
4. **Notifications** - For race updates and achievements
5. **Camera** (optional) - For profile pictures

Please grant all permissions for the best experience.
