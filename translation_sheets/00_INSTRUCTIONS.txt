PROJECT INFORMATION:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  App Name:         StepzSync
  Type:             Fitness Tracking & Racing App
  Platform:         Flutter (iOS & Android)
  Extracted Date:   2025-10-30
  Total Strings:    3734

HOW TO USE THESE FILES:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  • Each CSV file represents a different section of the app
  • Files are numbered (01_, 02_, etc.) for easy organization
  • Each CSV has three columns:
    - Column A: English Text (the original text to translate)
    - Column B: Screen/Context (where this text appears)
    - Column C: Notes (additional context)

TRANSLATION GUIDELINES:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  1. Keep the same tone and style as the English text
  2. For button labels, keep translations concise
  3. Pay attention to placeholders (marked in Notes)
  4. Placeholders like {count}, {name}, $variable should NOT be translated
  5. Maintain similar text length for UI elements
  6. Error messages should be clear and helpful
  7. Questions should end with appropriate punctuation

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  • Health & Fitness terms should use standard translations
  • Race terminology should be consistent throughout
  • Premium/Subscription text should be clear about benefits
  • Permission requests should explain why clearly

ADDING YOUR TRANSLATION:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  Option 1: Add a new column (D, E, etc.) for each target language
  Option 2: Create a copy of files for each language
  Option 3: Import into Excel/Google Sheets for easier editing

  Recommended: Open all CSV files in Excel, then save as .xlsx workbook

QUALITY ASSURANCE:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  ✓ Review translations in context of their screen
  ✓ Check that button labels fit on buttons
  ✓ Ensure error messages make sense
  ✓ Test that placeholders are preserved correctly
  ✓ Verify consistency across similar screens
